### AD Subscription Tracker

## Project Intent
The intent for this project was to have a permanent location that would hold the information for ad specifications and feature examples. This would reduce the need to constantly bug our Web Manager for trivial information, empower sales people to showcase this information to our clients and then give clients could a handy reference.

## Future Goal
The end goal was to grow this into a larger system for tracking what ads clients had/wanted and then they could manage them from the web interface.
